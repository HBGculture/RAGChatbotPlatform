  Scheduled updates, web scraping, and LLM-driven document optimization.
- **Self-Improvement via LLM Integration:**  
  Using OpenAI (and optionally other online LLMs) for prompt optimization and response refinement.
- **Dual API Key & Payment Processing:**  
  Option to use user-supplied API keys (free) or our managed API keys at 2Ã— token cost, with a minimum token purchase threshold.
- **Fun, Minimalistic Design:**  
  Default design with colorful palettes, light/dark mode, and customizable elements.
- **Low-Cost & Scalable Deployment:**  
  Utilizing free/low-cost hosting with a path to scale as needed.
- **Robust Security & Analytics:**  
  Modern authentication, logging, and future multi-modal integrations.

## Value Proposition
This platform is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, catering to both novices and advanced users. It minimizes guesswork through guided onboarding while offering powerful customization.
